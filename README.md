#  Graph Theory
Implementing algorithms to detect graph properties in Ruby as a way to study Graph Theory and Ruby programming language. 

## Detecting cycles in a graph 
In graph theory, a cycle is a path of edges and vertices wherein a vertex is reachable from itself. 
In [this](graph-cycle-detector.rb) program, given a directed graph, check whether the graph contains, at least, one cycle or none of them.
