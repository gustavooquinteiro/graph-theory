#  Graph Theory
Implementing algorithms to detect graph properties in Ruby as a way to study Graph Theory and Ruby programming language. 

## Detecting cycles in a graph 
In graph theory, a cycle is a path of edges and vertices wherein a vertex is reachable from itself. 

### Detecting cycles in a directed graph
In [this](directed-graph-cycle-detector.rb) program, given a directed graph, check whether the graph contains, at least, one cycle or none of them.

### Detecting cycles in a undirected graph
In [this](undirected-graph-cycle-detector.rb) program, given a undirected graph, check whether the graph contains, at least, one cycle or none of them.
